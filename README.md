## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Add your `.env` file in the server folder, based on the `example.env` file
4. Run `npm run dev`

## Development

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
3. I recommend running server and client in separate terminals (`npm run dev` for server, and `npm run start` for client), so you can keep your generated content stored on the server while testing changes to the client without having to re-generate content often.
